              <h1> Here are some great tips when it comes to creating!</h1>
			<ol> 
				<li>If you’re drawing something intricate like a person, human muscles, or an animal head, try finding shortcuts. Like for example, I’ve been trying to find a shortcut to drawing good lion heads, and my strategy has been drawing a square and then lines to know where to put the eyes, etc. As you go you can connect like say the one corner of the eye to a corner of the ear. It’s a good idea every now and then to erase your guide lines to see if the proportions line up since guide lines can make your drawing look better than it actually is.&nbsp;</li>
		  		<li>Mess around with your art supplies. A lot of my work is digital, and so I try to use the mechanics of the art tools to my advantage. A cool trick I found is that if you use water color in the same spot eventually it will dry up, and erase some of the color leaving only speckles and dots. This can make for a nice grass effect or if you want to add small dots to a night sky this would be a good shortcut.&nbsp;</li>
				<li>Make sure you stay creative when you’re making your artwork. This sounds rudimentary but there are a lot of times when I get inspired by one small concept, and after I’ve drawn that I lose interest, and have just wasted my time with an unfinished drawing. Instead of being fixated on one detail like seeing some stripes on a cartoon character, you should gain other ideas from video games, shows, things you saw outside, or even what you dreamed about and use those details for your drawing too. Maybe you end up drawing a festival full of your imaginary friends, and one of them has stripes, but this can motivate you to finish your drawing. It’s also a good idea to take breaks so you don’t get frustrated or tired of your artwork.</li>
